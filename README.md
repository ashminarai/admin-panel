# Admin Panel (Developed using ReactJS)

This admin panel is highly customizable to suit your project's needs. Below are some common tasks you can perform:

- **Adding New Pages**: Create new pages in the `src/pages` directory and add routes for them.

- **Styling**: Customize the admin panel's appearance by modifying the CSS or using a CSS-in-JS solution of your choice.

## Configuration

To configure the admin panel, you can update settings in the `.env` file, which should be added to your project root. Define variables like API endpoints, authentication details, and other environment-specific configurations.
